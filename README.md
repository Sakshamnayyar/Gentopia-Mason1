## Installation ðŸ’»
First, clone this repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:LittleYUYU/Gentopia-Mason.git
cd Gentopia-Mason
```
Next, we will create a virtual environment and install the library:
```
conda create --name gentenv python=3.10
conda activate gentenv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Most of the agent construction and execution activities will happen within `GentPool`. For the `gentopia` library to be used within `GentPool`, set up the global environment:
```
export PYTHONPATH="$PWD/Gentopia:$PYTHONPATH"
```
In addition, since we will be using OpenAI's API, we also need to create a `.env` file under `GentPool` and put the API Key inside. The key will be registered as environmental variables at run time.
```
cd GentPool
touch .env
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>" >> .env
```
Now you are all set! Let's create your first Gentopia Agent.


## Quick Start: Clone a Vanilla LLM Agent
GentPool has provided multiple template LLM agents. To get started, we will clone the "vanilla agent" from `GentPool/gentpool/pool/vanilla_template` with the following command:
```
./clone_agent vanilla_template <your_agent_name> 
```
This command will initiate an agent template under `./GentPool/gentpool/pool/<your_agent_name>`. The agent configuration can be found in `./GentPool/gentpool/pool/<your_agent_name>/agent.yaml` (note the agent type `vanilla`). The vanilla prompt it uses can be found in the source code of `Gentopia`; see `./Gentopia/gentopia/prompt/vanilla.py`.

You can now run your agent via:
```
python assemble.py <your_agent_name>
```
This vanilla agent simply sends the received user query to the backend LLM and returns its output. Therefore, for many complicated tasks, such as those requiring accessing the latest materials, it will fail. 

## Implement a Scholar LLM Agent with Tool Augmentation
In the second trial, we will create a Scholar agent which is augmented with multiple functions to access Google Scholar in real time.

This is based on the `scholar` agent we have created in the pool. As before, in this demo we simply clone it:
```
./clone_agent scholar <your_agent_name> 
```
Like before, this command created an agent under `./GentPool/gentpool/pool/<your_agent_name>`. Note from its configuration that scholar is an `openai`-type agent. As stated in its [Gentopia's implementation](./Gentopia/gentopia/agent/openai), this type of agent allows for function calling:
> OpenAIFunctionChatAgent class inherited from BaseAgent. Implementing OpenAI function call api as agent.

The available functions to the scholar agent have been listed in its configuration file `./GentPool/gentpool/pool/<your_agent_name>/agent.yaml`, and the implementation of these tools can be found in Gentopia's source code (mostly coming from the [google_scholar.py](./Gentopia/gentopia/tools/google_scholar.py) file, in this example).

Now, you are all set to query this scholar agent for the latest papers by certain authors, the summary of a certain paper, paper citations, etc.


## Remove an Agent
Sometimes an agent can upset you. To wipe it out completely,
```
./delete_agent <your_agent_name> 
```

## PDF Reader
Install PyPDF2 pip install PyPDF2

Sample prompt:
Can you read the PDF from this URL - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02067 and return its content in a string.

## Bonus Agent - Tool to translate language.

I have built an agent to translate language as mentioned in the input prompt. i have usedHugging Face transformers library to access a pretrained model.

Make sure to install transformers library: pip install transformers
Examples of prompt and responses of the agent:
1. USER - hello, how are you in spanish
   RESPONSE - In Spanish, "hello, how are you" is translated as "Hola, Â¿cÃ³mo estÃ¡s?"
2. USER - Mucho Gusto in english.
   RESPONSE - "Mucho gusto" translates to "Nice to meet you" in English.
